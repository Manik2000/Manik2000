ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Full-stack product engineer with comprehensive IT skills spanning backend, frontend, databases, and AI systems.
Sometimes a vibe coder, always a problem solver.
Currently architecting end-to-end solutions at TechTree while pursuing PhD research in Explainable AI. My dual perspective in industry and academia enables me to bridge theoretical innovations with practical engineering, creating products that are both technically sophisticated and commercially viable.
